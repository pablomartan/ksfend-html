    <h1>Climbing</h1>
    <p>
        Climbing is a risks sport. I like it because it places you, and only you,
        agains the wall. Even if this is so, it is also a very social sport. It is
        much funnier to climb with someone, try to figure out how to climb a wall
        or boulder togheter, and have fun in general.

        You can practice it indoors. This is the most convenient way if you live in
        a city.

        It can also be practiced outdoors, either bouldering, which is a 
        recent modality...

        ...or lead, wich requires much more equipment, and is more dangerous as
        you climb a lot higher.
