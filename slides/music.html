    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p>
        Music is a performing art, whose main element is sound. We could say that
        music is 'arranging sounds along time'. Some of the music styles I like are
        <a href="#jazz">Jazz</a>, <a href="#funk">Funk</a> and
        <a href="#indie">Indie Rock</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="jazz">Jazz</h2>
    <p>
        Jazz is an improvisational kind of music. The band takes a song, usually 32
        bars long, plays it, and then improvises based on the chords of the
        song.

    <h2 id="funk">Funk</h2>
    <p>
        Funk music is a genre with strong empahsis on syncopation and
        strong, sometimes repetitive rhythms, that invites to dance.

    <h2 id="indie">Indie Rock</h2>
    <p>
        Indie is short for 'independent'. It relates to the beginnings of the
        style, as the first bands were recorded and published by independent
        record labels. Nowadays it is as mainstream as any other genre.
