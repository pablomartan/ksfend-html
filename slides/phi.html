    <h1>Philosophy</h1>
    <p>
        Philosophy is an intelectual discipline that is very hard to
        characterize. It tackles the most abstract and difficult questions that
        humanity asked itself, like 'What is reality', 'What is knowledge',
        'What is the correct way to act', 'What is the perfect society', or
        'What is to be human'.

        It was born in ancient Greece, and constitutes the intellectual
        tradition of the West.

        Some of the questions philosophers asked themselves helped shape
        intellectual fields not much related to philosophy, like computer
        science or biology.
